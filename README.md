#  Attendance Marking Using Facial Recognition (Image Verifier in C)

This project is a **C-based image verifier system** for marking attendance.  
It simulates face recognition by comparing a new image with pre-registered face data.  
Built entirely using **the C programming language**, this system is a prototype for attendance systems used in schools and colleges.



-------



## Objective

- Pre-register students by storing their face image (in good lighting conditions).
- Then, verify a student’s identity by comparing one of the images with stored ones.
- If matched, mark the student's attendance in a '.csv' file.
